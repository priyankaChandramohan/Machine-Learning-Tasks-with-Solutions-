# Machine-Learning-Tasks-with-Solutions-

This repository contains the solutions to five machine-learning tasks. Each task focuses on a specific problem and several small tasks and provides a solution using machine learning techniques. The tasks included in this repository are as follows:

## Assignment 1: Boston Housing Data
In this task, we explore the Boston Housing dataset and apply various regression models to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes. The solution includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Assignment 2: Ground Cricket Chirps
This task involves analyzing the relationship between the temperature and the chirping rate of ground crickets. We build a regression model to predict the temperature based on the chirping rate using linear regression.

## Assignment 3: Brain Vs Body Weight
In this task, we investigate the correlation between the brain weight and body weight of different species. We employ a linear regression model to predict the brain weight based on the body weight.

## Assignment 4: Salary Discrimination
This task deals with analyzing salary data to identify potential gender-based salary discrimination. We apply classification algorithms to detect discriminatory patterns and evaluate the model's performance.

## Assignment 5: Car Worth
In this task, we analyze car attributes and their corresponding prices. We develop a regression model to predict the price of a car based on its characteristics using various machine learning techniques.

#### Each assignment in this repository includes a detailed explanation of the problem statement, the dataset used, the methodology employed, and the code implementation. Additionally, the solutions are provided in Python using popular machine-learning libraries.

Feel free to explore each task and the corresponding solution code to gain insights into machine learning techniques and their application to real-world problems.

Note: Please refer to the individual task folders for each assignment's specific datasets and code files.

Happy learning and exploring the world of machine learning!
